Razbit's (Very basic) operating system, RazOS.

TBH, I really have no specific goals for this project..
I hope that when I'll build the RPU, a computer made from ttl chips,
I could run this system on it. So, the code will have to be specific for
the RPU platform (8086-ish), and the platform will have to be able to
run code this complex. But, we'll see.. This is a hobby for which I don't
have much time..

Cheers,
Razbit
